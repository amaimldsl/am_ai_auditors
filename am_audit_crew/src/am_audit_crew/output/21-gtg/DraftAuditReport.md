The findings are categorized by risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and include detailed root cause analysis and recommendations for remediation.

## Detailed Findings

### Critical Findings

#### 1. Unauthorized Access
- **Description**: Several users (USER021, USER022, USER023, USER024) have unauthorized access to systems where they should have no access.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of proper access control enforcement and periodic access reviews.
- **Recommendation**: Immediately revoke unauthorized access and implement a robust access control mechanism with regular reviews.

#### 2. Transaction Limit Violations
- **Description**: Multiple transactions exceeded user approval limits (e.g., Transaction 0, 3, 7, 9, 14).
- **Root Cause**: Inadequate enforcement of transaction approval limits and lack of monitoring.
- **Recommendation**: Strengthen transaction approval processes and implement real-time monitoring of transaction limits.

#### 3. Unauthorized Changes in Change Management
- **Description**: Unauthorized changes were made by users (USER009, USER002, USER005) without proper authorization.
- **Root Cause**: Weak enforcement of change management policies and lack of oversight.
- **Recommendation**: Investigate unauthorized changes, enforce stricter change management policies, and provide additional training.

### High Findings

#### 1. Access Discrepancies

- **Root Cause**: Inaccurate access provisioning and lack of periodic access reviews.
- **Recommendation**: Conduct a comprehensive access review and align user access levels with the access matrix.

#### 2. Missing Change Tickets
- **Description**: Several changes (e.g., APIGateway modification by USER007, DatabaseIndex modification by USER001) were made without corresponding change tickets.
- **Root Cause**: Lack of adherence to change management procedures.

- **Recommendation**: Strengthen the vendor approval process, enforce finance approval for high-value transactions, and provide policy training to employees.

### Low Findings

#### 1. Compliant Transactions
- **Description**: Several transactions (T002, T003) were found to be compliant with the company's transaction policy.
