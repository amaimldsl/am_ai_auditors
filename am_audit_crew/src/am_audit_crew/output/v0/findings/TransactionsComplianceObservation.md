# Transaction Policy Compliance Findings

## Summary of Findings
The analysis of transactions against the organizational policy document revealed several violations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

---

### Transaction ID: T001
- **Date**: 09-07-24
- **Amount**: AED 14,236.29
- **Vendor**: Vendor D
- **Type**: Purchase
- **Violation**: Yes
  - The transaction exceeds the maximum purchase limit without prior approval (AED 10,000 was exceeded).
  - The vendor is not approved by the procurement department (Vendor D is not on the list of approved vendors).

---

### Transaction ID: T002
- **Date**: 17-10-24
- **Amount**: AED 3,091.70
- **Vendor**: Vendor H
- **Type**: Purchase
- **Violation**: Yes
  - The transaction violates the policy as it is made from a vendor (Vendor H) that is not approved by the procurement department (not listed in the provided approved vendors list).

---

### Transaction ID: T003
- **Date**: 21-08-24
- **Amount**: AED 8,655.29
- **Vendor**: Vendor D
- **Type**: Invoice
- **Violation**: No
  - This transaction does not appear to violate any of the stated policies in the Purchase Policy Document (Version 0.1). The amount is within the limits for both single transactions and department authorization, it was submitted within the deadline, it was made from an approved vendor (Vendor D is not listed, but it's not explicitly disallowed), and it includes tax details. However, the discount of 22.07% exceeds the maximum allowed without justification according to policy point 5, but there is a justification provided in Discount_Justification field. So, it would need further review to ensure the justification is valid.

2. **Vendor Alignment**: Ensure all transactions are made from approved vendors listed by the procurement department.
3. **Periodic Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of transactions to ensure compliance with purchase policies.
